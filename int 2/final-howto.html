        <center><h1 class=amillroe>How I made my generative art</h1></center>
        <h2>Part 1 - background</h2>
        <p>I started with the draw function (draw = function(){code}). Then I put a black background in side the draw function so I would not get left over shapes if one is moved. I then started on making stars to make the shape I used two small rectangles and made a plus shape I also made the opacity random to give it a blinking effect. Once I was satisfied with the shape I used two for loops to cover the black canvas with the stars I made. </p>

        <h2>Part 2 - targeting system</h2>
        <p>First I used the rect shape to make what looked a little like the ship from asteroids on the bottom of the canvas. I gave it a fixed y position but made it follow the x position of my mouse. I did this on the top but pointing down. I also did it on the sides of the canvas pointing towards the center and following the y position instead of the x position. Then I added two lines that line up with the arrows with the line function. I made one line follow the x value of my mouse and one follow the x value with my mouse. lastly I added a cyan colored ellipse that would follow the x and y values of my mouse.</p>
        <img class=imgdes src=sc2bg.png style=width:250px;height:200px/>
        <p> this is still sort of part of the targeting system. I made it so when ever you clicked, the blue dot shaped ellipse in the middle would turn red. A slight problem with this is that it is so laggy that the red dot would not always line up with the blue dot so it would just look wierd.</p>
